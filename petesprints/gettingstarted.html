                Interested in trying your hand at 3D printing? But aren’t sure where to go or what to do? 
                Much of what I’ve learned over the past 4 years has been self-taught. I’ve learned a lot through trial and error, but now can pass the knowledge to you.  
                First, look for a good 3D printer. The printer I got can be found here, Qidi Printer  It came with no need for assembly and the support from the company was wonderful. 
                Once you get a printer and even before you receive it you can watch many videos online about how to use the printer and how to set it up. 
                Link to a good video about the basics of printing. The last part about printing is getting the model ready to print. 
                The model you want to 3D print will need to be converted into code that the printer can read.  
                The printer reads a code known as STL. STL is a file format native to the stereolithography CAD software created by 3D Systems. 
                There are many free programs that can prepare a model to be printed. The printer manufacturer for the most part always has their only program that can prepare the models.
                My favorite is called LycheeSlicer. Costs me $5 a month but gives me all the options I need to get a good 3D print. 
                With these steps I hope you can get on the road to your own 3D printing hobby.
